## Project Overview

This project simulates a data request from a potential investor evaluating the acquisition of *Maven Movies*, a movie rental business. Acting on behalf of the buyer, a formal letter outlines several business-critical questions aimed at understanding store operations, inventory structure, customer activity, and revenue streams.

Using structured SQL queries on a relational database, this project explores:

- Store locations and manager assignments
- Detailed film inventory by store, category, and rating
- Replacement cost breakdowns by store and genre
- Customer profiles with address and activity status
- Payment and rental summaries to identify high-value customers
- Simulated advisor and investor tables

Each query is tailored to reflect real-world stakeholder concerns and demonstrates practical SQL skills, including JOINs, GROUP BY, CASE statements, UNION, and aggregation.

>  **NOTE**: This project is designed as a **data exploration exercise**, not a full analysis. The focus is on extracting relevant data to support business understanding, not deriving insights or trends.
